To understand the data, you have to realize that there are multiple radar observations over the course of an hour, and only one gauge observation (the 'Expected'). That is why there are multiple rows with the same 'Id'.

The columns in the datasets are:

Id:  A unique number for the set of observations over an hour at a gauge.
minutes_past:  For each set of radar observations, the minutes past the top of the hour that the radar observations were carried out.  Radar observations are snapshots at that point in time.
radardist_km:  Distance of gauge from the radar whose observations are being reported.
Ref:  Radar reflectivity in km
Ref_5x5_10th:   10th percentile of reflectivity values in 5x5 neighborhood around the gauge.
Ref_5x5_50th:   50th percentile
Ref_5x5_90th:   90th percentile
RefComposite:  Maximum reflectivity in the vertical column above gauge.  In dBZ.
RefComposite_5x5_10th
RefComposite_5x5_50th
RefComposite_5x5_90th
RhoHV:  Correlation coefficient (unitless)
RhoHV_5x5_10th
RhoHV_5x5_50th
RhoHV_5x5_90th
Zdr:    Differential reflectivity in dB
Zdr_5x5_10th
Zdr_5x5_50th
Zdr_5x5_90th
Kdp:  Specific differential phase (deg/km)
Kdp_5x5_10th
Kdp_5x5_50th
Kdp_5x5_90th
Expected:  Actual gauge observation in mm at the end of the hour.
